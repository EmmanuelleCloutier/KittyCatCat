#  Kitty Cat Cat

**Kitty Cat Cat** is a 2D top-down game where you control a demonic cat.  
The goal is to **accumulate as many points as possible** in the **shortest amount of time**, without dying!

##  Gameplay

- Move your cat **up, down, left, and right** like in a classic top-down game.
- Earn points by:
  - **Collecting** balls of yarn,
  - **Destroying** normal cats,
  - **Catching** mice.

- The player has **5 lives**.  
  If all lives are lost, the game ends.

- **As time passes**, **more enemy cats** spawn, making survival increasingly harder.

- **Enemy cats**, along with **balls of yarn** and **mice**, **spawn randomly** across the map.  
  Enemy cats actively chase the player to attack.

##  Development

This project was developed using **Godot Engine**, with both **C#** and **GDScript**.  
It continues a project started during the **Fall 2024 semester** at university, as part of exploring standard game engines.

The main goal was to **deepen my understanding of Godot** by building a **simple**, **fun**, and **quick-to-play** game â€” perfect for filling short breaks.
